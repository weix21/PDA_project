### Introduction 

In recent years, foodborne illness has become a concerning public health problem in the U.S. A large proportion of foodborne illness cases were attributed to biological reasons, for example, different types of pathogens. According to the recent reports from the foodborne disease outbreak monitoring and coordinating systems in CDC and FDA , Salmonella, Escherichia coli (usually called E.coli, especially the type produces Shiga Toxin), Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobactor have been the four primary pathogen since the beginning of this century. Capturing the potential patterns of the outbreaks for these four pathogens could help public health workers prevent outbreaks and respond to emergency more effectively. As residents in New England, we concern about food safety problems in this area all the time. The states in New England share similar climate and dietary habit, indicating that they might take similar risk in foodborne illness issues. However, few studies discussed about the foodborne illness in New England as an entity. In this project, we will use data from Pathogen Detection in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as a primary source to review and investigate the patterns of foodborne illness due to the four priority pathogens.

### Data

We use data from NCBI Pathogen Detection [LINK] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/)
